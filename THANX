I wish to thank the following people:

* Mark A. Biggar and Ilya for the original versions.
* John Peacock and Steffen Beyer for the discussions and ideas.
* Mark Dickinson for spotting bugs.
* HH for listening to my boring explanations.
* J. Bruce Fields for bug reports, patches, and discussions about bmod/bdiv
  and for finding the dreaded "Out of memory" cause.

List not complete ;)

Math::BigFloat:
 * just do it

Math::BigFloat::Constant:
 * do it?

Math::BigInt:
 * remove trace()
 * ++,-- could be faster in Bigint via hardcoded (manual) increment
 * look at mul() and div()
 * bpow() could be faster by not using div()

Math::String::Charset
 * finish bigram support
 * binaer search in bstr() to find out base number?

Math::String:
 * finish cache string form  and dec/inc

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love

See various .pm files.

Math::BigFloat:
 * ! round(): look at rounding (Toms bug report)
 * sqrt (seems to do to much work)
 * ! div() 
 * ! bpow()

Math::BigFloat::Constant:
 * really?

Math::BigInt:
 * remove trace()
 * objectify() is too slow and questionable
 * ++,-- could be faster in Bigint via hardcoded (manual) increment
 * look at mul() and div() for more speed
 * bpow() could be faster by not using div()

Math::String::Charset
 * ! finish bigram support
 * binaer search in bstr() to find out base number?

Math::String:
 * finish cache string form and dec/inc

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!

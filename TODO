See various .pm files.

General:
 * Copy on write (helps for $x = -$x; cases etc)

Math::BigFloat:
 * ! round(): some bugs may lurk in there (warnings)
 * ! bsqrt() (old variant seems to do to much work)
 * ! bdiv() is broken for 2 / 1.41 
 * ! bmod() 
 * ! bpow()
 * complete doc abot accuracy vs precision
 * accuracy()

Math::BigFloat::Constant:
 * really?

Math::BigInt:
 * remove trace()
 * objectify() is too slow and questionable
 * ++,-- could be faster in Bigint via hardcoded (manual) increment
 * look at mul() and div() for more speed
 * bpow() could be faster by not using div()
 * scan_for_zeros is slower than it needs to be (affects rounding speed)

Math::String::Charset
 * ! finish bigram support
 * different charsets at each pos (for grouping)
 * binaer search in bstr() to find out base number?

Math::String:
 * finish cache string form and dec/inc

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
